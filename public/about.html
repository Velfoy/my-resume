<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Here I will tell you what influenced me while I was growing up and what led me to what kind of person I am now.</p>
<h2>A few factors:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>My dad and the way he raised me.<br> He gave me many life lessons that I will never forget.He laid the foundation in me for a person who can achieve a lot without losing a piece of myself in the process.</li>
    <li>My brother.<br>I got a lot of interests watching my brother, now looking back I understand that although not all hobbies are the same as my brother's, he contributed to what I'm interested in and what kind of person I am for society</li>
    <li>My school life.<br> At the same time as I was studying, I also became a part of society and tried to join it, although I didn't always like these companies, but each of them changed me and helped me understand how to adapt in this world to circumstances and to people</li>
    <li>My father's death and the war.<br> Each of these situations broke me, after the first one I realized that the world is not as beautiful as it seemed to me and that all the colors in my world were brought by people who were nearby, so I realized the value of the moments that we live day by day and that every breath is valuable .The second one showed how terrible the world in which we live, that only the family will always be there and that this is the most important thing in my life.</li>
